# Deep Loma

 ![Doobies, deep loma mascot](/doobies.png)

As now I've published out this repo's location, I guess I am obliged to add README.md. This repo is my childish (but still best) effort to grasp at what this "protein-protein docking" thing is all about.

1. `/guesswork` holds all "hypotheses". Runner is in `/guesswork\/bin`
2. `/mof` is metaheuristic diletancy. Runner is in root, called `experiment.js`
3. `/parsers` is for parsers
4. `/vis-~` are various versions of visualizer which I felt like I can't let go in git version history. Actively worked on one right now is `/vis-for3-r`
